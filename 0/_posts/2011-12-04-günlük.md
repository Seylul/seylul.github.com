Dear diary,
Two days later i will converge (i have never use this word in my life) to my violin, i hope.


Today is my friend's that not important for me anymore, birthday .. But if i miss
her when i put my head to my pillow in the nights, she is still important and special for me..
She isn't my first friend acting as her.. I have lived this emotions every
time but with anybodyelse..
People are cruel, extravagant.. People say that the biggest blessing is
`forgetting`, i think this isn't true completely, because i forget some bad acts
of my friends then i say to myself "i don't confidence to her/him" then i forget
and i find myself in pain again..
By the way, i am putting two points to end of my sentences, this join to my writing more emotions eheh..
